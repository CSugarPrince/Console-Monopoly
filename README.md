# Console-Monopoly

The classic game of Monopoly reconstructed in Python and playable on the Windows Command Prompt.

To play, simply go to the 'dist/' folder and download the console_monopoly.exe. It will probably be recognized as a virus by your Computer's antivirus software but just ignore that for now.

Currently, it's still in it's prototype stage and has a ways to go until it's a full adaptation of the game.
